# DeepLearning_Disaster-Events-from-Twitter-Stream
A NLP based model to identify and predict disaster events from a public social media source, Twitter, in this case.

In the modern era, social media platforms like Twitter have begun to play a vital role in real-time disaster reporting. Rapidly detecting disaster events from Twitter posts enables faster response by emergency first responders. However,automatically classifying disaster-related tweets from irrelevant chatter poses a challenging natural language processing problem. In this deep learning project, we will develop models to accurately identify disaster messages from Twitter streams. We will extract features from the text data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF vectors and count vectorization. These feature representations will be used to train classifiers, including ridge regressions, Naive Bayes, SVM, BERT-based CNN model and LSTM Networks. Additionally, we will experiment with pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe and advanced language models such as BERT. We will compare our approaches to state-of-the-art AI systems including GPT-4.
